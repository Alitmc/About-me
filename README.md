I have been working since 2020 as a software developer, and my focus is on C# and VB.NET.
I have experienced some modules, such as CRM, Accounting, Manufacturing, Production and Inventory.
After completing my bachelor's degree in industrial engineering, I started my work at the Partow Pooyesh Company as a junior developer. 
After while I was promoted to the software team and, in addition, provided a major part of troubleshooting and developing commands related to the database. 
I work with SQL (SSMS) for the database part, and after three years of work, I gained good experience in back-end and front-end development using the C#, VB.NET, and SQL. 
Right now, I am practicing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and trying to improve my front-end abilities and working on web branches.
